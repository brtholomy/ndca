# NDCA
### Short for "N Dimensional Cellular Automata". 

NDCA is a handy tool for creating grids of arbitrary dimensions, and running a cellular automata in these grids.

You can create individual grids and run cellular automata based only on local rules for that n dimensional space,
or you can create non local neighbourhoods between n dimensional grids that you have created, and pack them as a
"column". 

This tool was created to simulate cortical colon dynamics in the brain, a cortical mini-colon is the "elementary
processing unit" of cortex, consisting of rougly 110 neurons. 


I aim to build a simulation environment, where it will be possible to simulate a giant ensemble of these "colons"
and see how they interact with each other; in the hopes of understanding the chaotic behaviour of neuronal dynamics
better.

Please e mail me at: siyarbahadir@gmail.com, if you have any questions regarding the tool and bug fixes.
